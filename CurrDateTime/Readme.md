# CurrentDateTime program

This program outputs the current date and time.

## How to build the program

To build the program use the **Makefile** in the same folder as this document. If you run the make command with no arguments it will create an executable file called **CurrentDateTime.exe**.

Note that you will need to change the value of CXX at the top of **Makefile** if you are using a C++ compiler other than g++.

The source files for the program are to be found in the same folder as this document, and in the following folder:


            ..\shared\DateTime
